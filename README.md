Hello, I'm Huguini79 and my hobby is computing, like programming, installing drivers to operating systems and cybersecurity.

And one of my featured projects is HuguiniOS

HuguiniOS is an open source operating system developed in C and in Assembly x86 by Huguini79 in 3 months, my operating system is made from scratch, without using FreeBSD, Linux or Unix, only from scratch writing the bootloader, the drivers, the kernel etc...

And there are a lot of projects that I made too
